## Introduction

Have you ever heard of the game, "Whack-a-Mole"? This article contains information about why I wanted to make the advanced version of this game, and what kind of game it is.

## Background

I thought that the most important thing in creating a program that aims to prevent dementia is reaction speed. Examples of progamers' reaction speed explain it clearly.

Professional gamers are among the professions that are the most resistant to dementia. [In the website where you can measure your reaction time](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime), these gamers got 150ms of delay in average. However, me, just a normal person,  had an average response time of 203 ms.

I wanted to make a game that can explain player's possiblitity of dementia through average response time, but also able to fascinate older generation.

Since "Whack-a-Mole" goes well with the older generation and is closely related to the measurement of reaction speed, I thought to make it based on this.

## Rule of the Game

Basic rule of the game is to click the moles if you see it. In several holes, moles will come out and you have to click all of them.

However, the very different part of the ADVANCED "Whack-a-Mole" is that the size of holes varies. Since smaller holes are harder to touch and detect, clicking smaller moles will be given higher points.

The game ends when the player misses too many moles or hits an empty hole.

When the game is over, the player is able to see the average response time.

By repeating the game, player can decrease their delay and increase their concentration. In other words, player is able to prevent dementia.

## Versatility of the Game

Since the game is pretty simple, it is able to make different types of modes. The picture below is one of the mode that I thought of. This is a mode that gives player more point when clicking certain moles and ends the game when clicking other certain moles. Since clicking all moles will lead to failure, players must focus, which leads to lower possibility of dementia (The rule might change though).

Since this is such a simple game, it would be easy to make not only these mods, but many other mods as well.
