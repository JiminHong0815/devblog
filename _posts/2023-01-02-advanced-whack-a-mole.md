## Introduction

Have you ever heard of the game, "Whack-a-Mole"? This article contains information about why I wanted to make this game, and what kind of game it is.

## Background

I thought that the most important thing in creating a program that aims to prevent dementia is reaction speed. Examples of progamers' reaction speed explain it clearly.

Professional gamers are among the professions that are the most resistant to dementia. [In the website where you can measure your reaction time](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime), these gamers got 150ms of delay in average. However, me, just a normal person,  had an average response time of 203 ms.

I wanted to make a game that can explain player's possiblitity of dementia through average response time, but also able to fascinate older generation.

Since "Whack-a-Mole" goes well with the older generation and is closely related to the measurement of reaction speed, I thought to make it based on this.
