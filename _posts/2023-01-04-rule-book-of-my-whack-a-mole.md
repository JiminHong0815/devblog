## Introduction

Last week, at the idea lottery with my team members, my whack-a-mole was luckily selected. Therefore, the specific rule and approximate UIs of the game was made through brainstorming and discussion. In this posting, the things that we've done will be written.

## Icon

This is the app icon that I made using figma with icons from [flaticons.com](flaticons.com). To be honest, I think my icon won't be the one because I think it's bad. :(

## Tutorial : How to Lose

There are several rules in the game. However, since I have designed the tutorial of how to lose, I would like to talk about the things I've done. If you are interested in other tutorials or other parts of the game, go to my other team member's blog.

Though it's only third week of learning using figma, making posts on my blog, and learning UXs and stuff, I feel that I am doing this pretty well. Thanks for reading my post!
