## Introduction

Since I have to make "Advanced Whack-A-Mole", I learned how to make the game by using Android Studio. Therefore, I would like to introduce how I learned using Android Studio in this post.

## Process

At the very first moment when I opened the app, everything was making me dizzy. I didn't even know how to add a button or a text box on the screen, since there were so many wordy stuffs to click on.

But learning spacing adjustment and adding buttons and text boxes, I finally took my first step of using Android Studio.

In addition, I also learned how to add pictures. What I added to my practice demo app is this avatar below.

## End

Although adding text boxes, pictures, and buttons are only the things what I have learned, I am so proud of me. THE END.
